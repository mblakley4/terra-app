# The *Terra* Project

#### Servo Terra Nostra!
"Save Our Earth!"


## Summary:
This web application is meant to support pledges that avoid single-use plastics, specifically Plastic Water Bottles (PWB).  This application will help the community of pledges to see how much plastic their unified efforts can prevent. As pledges grow, the app will calculate how many pounds of plastic we **didn't** use.  The idea is simple: we use less, they produce less.

> USE LESS, PRODUCE LESS
